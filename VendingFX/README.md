 # VENDING MACHINE PROJECT
 A vending machine system that has all the usual Vending machine functionalities with a GUI interface(Java FX).

The vending machine is a money-less operation where clients buy credit using an App and can then use that credit to prducts in the real vending machines, make photocopies in the library and buy meals in the café. 

The vending machine software loads up the ‘client’ and 'product' files on start up. The files contain the user details (username, current credit and password) and  product details (product name, cost and quantity).

To buy a product the user has to identify themselves (username and password), have enough credit and specify the product location in the vending machine. 

An admin can reload products back into the vending machine and “shut down the system". This shutdown process stores the current product and customer information to another csv file that is reloaded on product start-up.

The main functionality of the program:

 - It incorporates persistent files into the system, as specified above.

 - Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to the system using JavaFX; 

 - Offers operator authentication services for users and admin.
